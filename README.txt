Plugin to display a nerd calendar on a widget. It displays if today is a nerd holiday (and what holiday is) or when will be the next nerd holiday.

== Description ==

This plugin downloads and displays in a widget the current year's nerd holidays. 
Every new year will be made available the calendar with the updated holidays, the administrators have only to click on the update button in the settings page of the plugin to complete the process. There will be a little dashboard widget to remember you to update the calendar (only when the year changes and the new calendar is available), but if you forgot to update, no worries! The widget will display the holidays that are recurrent each year: you won't have the year's specific holidays, but the calendar won't be broken.


### Today is...

If today is a nerd holiday, the widget will display the name of the holiday. Clicking on it will be opened another browser tab to a source of informations about that holiday.

### Next Nerd Holiday...

If today is **not** a nerd holiday, will be displayed the next holiday date with all the holidays in that date, because there can be more holidays on a single date!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. In the Appearance -> Widgets menù, place the **BeaverNerdHolidays** widget in your desired location

Done! The widget needs no settings, but if you want to contribute to the diffusion of the plugin, go in the **Nerd Holidays** menù, and check the checkbox "Display the developer's link". The displayed link will be small and non-obtrusive.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the plugin free? =

Yes!

= Will this plugin slow down my Wordpress? =

The plugin is very lightweight, i engineered it to clean all it's traces if you decide to deactivate it, and to have a tidy installation and updates. So, the answer is no.

= Can i add my personal nerd holidays? =

In this version, is not possible to add your nerd holidays through the settings page (but if you know how to add lines in a database table, nothing is impossible for you). For the next version, i plan to add some management actions on the calendar in the settings page to let everyone add/modify/delete dates.
